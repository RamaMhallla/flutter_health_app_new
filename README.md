## ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction Model

- Trained using clinical features such as:
    - Age
    - Sex
    - Blood Pressure
    - Cholesterol
    - Max Heart Rate
- Built with Keras (Dense + Dropout layers)
- Converted to `.tflite` for integration with the Flutter app
### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Training Script:
#Located in: `Heart Disease Prediction/model/train_model.py`

## ü©ª Pneumonia Detection from X-Ray

- Based on Kaggle dataset:  
  [Chest X-ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)
- Trained on Google Colab using CNN
- Data processed with `ImageDataGenerator` and resizing
- Exported model to TensorFlow Lite format

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Notebook:

Located in: `Detecting Pneumonia using Chest X-Ray/xray_model_training.ipynb`

## üì± Flutter App

- Collects patient inputs (cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.)
- Integrates with the `.tflite` heart model for real-time prediction
- Receives sensor data (e.g., from Raspberry Pi) via MQTT
- Uses a mock script (`mock_sender.py`) to simulate real-time data
